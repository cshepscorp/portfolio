          I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer utilizing over a decade of
          experience with Adobe Creative Suite and e-commerce management skills
          to craft and design attractive and intuitive user experiences on the
          web. I've been in the workforce for a long time working in front-end
          web content management and basic development and recently decided I'd
          like to get to know more about how things work behind the scenes, as
          well. When I'm tasked with a project I'm not 100% sure how to complete
          - I get excited - and then I get to work!
